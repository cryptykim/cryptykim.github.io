    <b>Active root-of-trust on IoT devices @ <i>UC Irvine</i></b><br>
    <span style="font-size:80%">
    Despite there are a lot of work to design root-of-trust on cyber-physical devices, most of them claim it
    in a passive way in terms that the security properties can be verified only when it is requested 
    and functions of the device cannot be actively protected.
    Our work is aiming to build a root-of-trust architecture on devices so that the essential functions of a device 
    will be guaranteed even with the presence of malware with minimal hardware support/modification.

    <b>Privacy-enhanced architecture in cellular network @ <i>UC Irvine with KAIST</i></b><br>
  <span style="font-size:80%">
    It has been widely reported that mobile operators have been selling user's information for their lucrative purpose,
    however, the adversary models including the mobile carriers have been overlooked. In this project, we aim to enhance
    user's privacy even from the network operators' perspective and we formally verify the new variant we suggest with Tamarin.

    <b>Development of a firmware on mobile SoC @ <i>LGE</i></b><br>
  <span style="font-size:80%">
    In mobile devices, power consumption, stability, and performance are the most important components. Especially,
    hardware and firmware should be sophisticatedly designed to minimize power consumption. In this project, we
    developped a firmware including peripheral drivers, power management drivers, and inter-communicate drivers, and
    analyszed unintended power leakage in various scenarios.

    <b>Research on automotive systems security @ <i>LGE</i></b><br>
  <span style="font-size:80%">
    In recent years, a large amount of electronic vehicles have been demanding for enviroment and deployed 
    all around the world. Accordingly, many works have studied to improve security in automotive systems
    as there were little to no security features originally. In this project, we developped a secure update
    system (PoC) based on <a href="https://uptane.github.io/">Uptane</a> project. Also, we developped a firewall
    with the security requirements from OEM. Lastly, we developped a digital key archietecture (PoC) proposed by Car
    Connectivity Consortium.
